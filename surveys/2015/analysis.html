<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>To foster its developments, the JabRef core team has carried out an online survey from October 18, 2015 to November 14, 2015. 
We were interested in getting the opinion of community members.</p>

<p>The survey consisted of 3 sets of questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What do you think about the current features?</li>
  <li>Which new features should be included?</li>
  <li>Who are JabRef users?</li>
</ul>

<p>Total, we got 428 responses, which included 31 incomplete responses.</p>

<p>The analysis of the results is structured in the following order:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Who are the JabRef users.</li>
  <li>What contribution to expect from users.</li>
  <li>How do they currently use JabRef.</li>
  <li>Which new features should be included.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="who-are-the-jabref-users">Who are the JabRef users</h2>

<h3 id="german-and-english-speakers-are-the-most-numerous-among-the-responders">German and English speakers are the most numerous among the responders</h3>

<p><img src="graphs/Mainspokenlanguage.png" alt="Mainspokenlanguage" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>German were the most numerous responders.</li>
  <li>English speakers represented (only) 25% of responders.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="context-of-use-is-mostly-professional-but-many-usages">Context of use is mostly professional, but many usages</h3>

<p><img src="graphs/IUseJabRefInTheContextOf.png" alt="IUseJabRefInTheContextOf" /></p>

<p>(multiple answers allowed)</p>

<ul>
  <li>More than half of JabRef use is done in a context of professional work.</li>
  <li>Half of use is for studies (including PhD).</li>
  <li>A third is for personal work.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Conclusion: a wide variety of contexts!</p>

<ul>
  <li>Natural sciences, formal sciences and professions are the dominant fields of activity of the responders.</li>
  <li>Humanities and social sciences represent “only” about 15% of usage.</li>
  <li>A few sub-fields dominate:
    <ul>
      <li>Physics, computer sciences, engineering and biology makes about 50%.</li>
      <li>Adding mathematics, chemistry, economics makes 2/3.</li>

<h2 id="how-jabref-is-currently-used">How JabRef is currently used</h2>

<h3 id="jabref-is-their-primary-bibliographic-software">JabRef is their primary bibliographic software</h3>

<p><img src="graphs/JabRefIsMyMainBibliographicSoftware.png" alt="Main primary software is" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>For 80% of the responders, JabRef is the main bibliographic software.</li>
  <li>For the other 20%, either JabRef is their secondary bibliographic software, or they do not use JabRef.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="if-not-using-jabref-zotero-a-plain-text-editor-and-mendeley-are-the-most-popular">If not using JabRef, Zotero, a plain text editor and Mendeley are the most popular</h3>

<p><img src="graphs/MyMainBibliographicSoftwareIsNotJabRefItis.png" alt="Main primary software is" /></p>

<p>Among the 20% not using JabRef as their primary bibliographic software, numerous alternatives are cited, and the reasons are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It works better with my OS (Bibdesk and Bookends for Mac; Citavi for Windows; Erathosthenes for Android)</li>
  <li>Of a better GUI (Erathosthenes, Librarian)</li>
  <li>My colleagues use this other software (Zotero, Citavi, Endnote)</li>
  <li>File format
    <ul>
      <li>I want complete control over the BibTeX file (emacs and other text editors)</li>

      <li>I do collaborative work (Bibsonomy; Mendeley)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Direct import of references, even from webpages (Mendeley; Zotero)</li>
  <li>PDF file capabilities
    <ul>
      <li>Extract information from PDF files (Docear; Mendeley)</li>
      <li>Annotation inside the PDF files (Mendeley)</li>
      <li>Management of PDF files (Mendeley; Zotero)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Tagging and categorizing references is easier (Mendeley; DoCear; Zotero)</li>
  <li>Better automated features (Mendeley, Zotero)</li>
  <li>Better integration with my text-processor (Mendeley; Zotero)</li>
  <li>Additionnally:

      <li>Better integration of third party services (Zotero)</li>
      <li>Auto-export segments for a specific paper (Zotero)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Conclusion: clear reasons exist for not using JabRef primarily. Features to be added have been given. Do they match the users’ priority lists?</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="tex-world-softwares-dominate-the-use-of-jabref">TeX-world softwares dominate the use of JabRef</h3>

<p><img src="graphs/IUseJabRefPrimarilyInConnexionWith.png" alt="I Use JabRef Primarily In Connexion With" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>The primary software used with JabRef is related to TeX in 80% of the cases.</li>
  <li>Word processors represent the primary software for about 10% of responders.</li>
  <li>4% of responders declare using JabRef for itself.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="graphs/IUseJabRefSecondarilyInConnexionWith.png" alt="I Use JabRef Secondarily In Connexion With" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>About half of the responders use JabRef in connection with only one software.</li>
  <li>Bib(La)TeX is the secondary software for about 25% of responders.</li>
  <li>Word processors represents the secondary software for about 20% of responders.</li>
  <li>A wide diversity of other software are being used, also most represent a minority.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Conclusion: while TeX-world remains the primary target, other usages should not be forgotten.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="english-is-the-primary-language-for-the-user-interface">English is the primary language for the user interface</h3>

<p><img src="graphs/IuseJabRefwiththeinterfacein.png" alt="IuseJabRefwiththeinterfacein" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>About 2/3 of responders use the interface in English .</li>
  <li>20% in German.</li>
  <li>5% in French.</li>
  <li>Use of other languages for the interface is quite rare among responders.</li>
</ul>

<p>50% of German- and French-speaking responders use the interface in their own language.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Conclusion: how useful are the localizations (versus a better English help, for example)?</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="latest-stable-version-is-the-most-popular">Latest stable version is the most popular</h3>

<p><img src="graphs/JabrefVersionInUse.png" alt="JabrefVersionInUse" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>Two-thirds of the users run the latest stable version.</li>
  <li>As could be expected, few run a development snapshot.</li>
</ul>

<p>Among the 10% who answered “Other” (i.e. 32 responders), we get:</p>

<p><img src="graphs/JabrefVersionInUseOther.png" alt="JabrefVersionInUseOther" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>An order of stable versions mostly sorted by age.</li>
  <li>About 15% run the version proposed by their OS (and this is likely underestimated).</li>
  <li>Very old versions are still in use.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Conclusion: since stability is a requirement for most users, and since there will be no more beta versions, some guidance  in choosing the proper version to download is needed.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="the-most-popular-os-are-windows-and-linux-then-mac">The most popular OS are Windows and Linux, then Mac</h3>

<p><img src="graphs/MyOSis.png" alt="MyOSis" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>There is not an overly-dominant OS:
    <ul>
      <li>45% of responders run Windows</li>
      <li>43% of responders run Linux</li>
      <li>12% of responders run Mac</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Among the Windows versions, Windows 7 is the most popular.</li>
  <li>Windows 10 is already more popular than Windows 8.</li>
  <li>Very few responders are still using Windows XP.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Conclusion: compatibility with Windows, Linux and Mac is a key feature.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="hand-edition-of-a-bibtex-file-is-not-rare">Hand edition of a BibTeX file is not rare</h3>

<p><img src="graphs/IEditMyBibTeXFileByHand.png" alt="IEditMyBibTeXFileByHand" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>Most of responders edit, at least sometimes, their BibTeX files by hand.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: with a perfect JabRef, they would not edit their BibTeX file by hand…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The analysis of the about 200 reasons given by the responders shows that they are related to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Personal taste/habits (7). <em>Challenge for developers: make JabRef so good that you change your habit/taste.</em></li>
  <li>Computers where JabRef is not available. <em>This underlines the strength of having the database stored in a text file.</em></li>
  <li>Mass editing by search &amp; replace (24). <em>Seems a much-demanded missing feature.</em></li>
  <li>Importation and exportation issues:
    <ul>
      <li>Importation of entries collected from the web (22). <em>Import filters need to be improved, whether because numerous databases on the web provide wrongly-formatted references, or because the import filter does not match the format definition.</em></li>
      <li>Exportation of entries (8), especially to conform with specific journal citation styles. <em>Exportation styles should be easier to customize.</em></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Solving issues related to character encoding (20). <em>Improvement in the database cleaning feature</em></li>
  <li>Cleaning (23), <em>Improvement in the database cleaning feature (again)</em> such as:
    <ul>
      <li>Deletion of some unnecessary fields.</li>
      <li>« Search for duplicate » is not good enough in JabRef.</li>
      <li>Syntax error and bugs in the database.</li>
      <li>Line breaks in the abstracts</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Need for specific entry types and fields (12). <em>Make the GUI more friendly with custom fields and entries</em></li>
  <li>Text editing is faster for small changes (9). <em>Will a GUI ever beat emacs?</em></li>
  <li>Solving issues related to PDF files (filename and file path) (4). <em>Improvement in the file management</em></li>
  <li>Conflicts when merging changes in a version control system (4). <em>Make the file format more consistent.</em></li>
  <li>Insufficient support of the BibLaTeX format (4). <em>Improvement in the BibLaTeX format support.</em></li>
  <li>Preserve compatibility with other software (3) <em>Which software?</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Direct copy-paste of a bibTeX entry is currently faster in a text-editor than in JabRef (1). And it would be if “new entry”-&gt;”empty” could be selected (no need to delete the template). <em>Need for specific button (and a new keyboard shortcut)?</em></li>
  <li>When two entries are accidentally copied into one, JabRef keeps silent (1) <em>Detect this.</em></li>
  <li>Editing group tree is tedious in JabRef (1). <em>Improve group tree editing.</em></li>
  <li>Management of abbreviations is tedious in JabRef (1). <em>Improve abbreviation management</em></li>
  <li>JabRef is slow for very large databases (1). <em>Make JabRef faster</em></li>
  <li>To add longer abstracts than appears allowed by default (1). <em>Is there a limit?</em></li>
  <li>JabRef forgets the configured fields (required and optional) for several entry types. So after every start of JabRef for example publisher and address is missing in the required fields tab for the entry type @book. I can add it but after the next start of JabRef it’s gone. <em>A bug?</em></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Conclusion: feature improvements are likely to reduce the use of a text editor.</p>

<h3 id="the-default-key-pattern-is-ok-but-the-use-of-another-pattern-is-common">The default key pattern is ok, but the use of another pattern is common</h3>

<p><img src="graphs/WhatKindOfBibTeXKeyPatternDoYouUse.png" alt="WhatKindOfBibTeXKeyPatternDoYouUse" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>Half of responders use the default key pattern</li>
  <li>One third use a different key pattern</li>
</ul>

<p>Among the alternative key patterns, here are the fields used to build the pattern:</p>

<p><img src="graphs/FieldsUsedToBuildTheKeyPattern.png" alt="FieldsUsedToBuildTheKeyPattern" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>Author and Year are used in 70% of the cases.</li>
  <li>The key pattern is based ONLY on Author and Year in 40% of cases.</li>
  <li>In 40% of cases, another information than Author, Year, Journal and Title is used.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Conclusion: ability to alter the default key pattern is a required feature.</p>

<h3 id="both-types-of-special-characters-ie-ü-and-u-are-used">Both types of special characters (i.e. ü and "{u}) are used</h3>

<p><img src="graphs/ToStoreSpecialCharactersIMostlyUse.png" alt="ToStoreSpecialCharactersIMostlyUse" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>52% of responders use direct input</li>
  <li>44% prefer the plain LaTeX encoding</li>
  <li>among the 4% remaining, the ways of dealing with special characters are:
    <ul>
      <li>Both</li>
      <li>Direct input for simple special characters only</li>
      <li>No special characters at all</li>
    </ul>

<p><img src="graphs/MyDataBaseIsSavedUsingTheEncoding.png" alt="MyDataBaseIsSavedUsingTheEncoding" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>UTF-8 encoding is mentioned by 81% of the 340 responders who have specified an encoding.</li>
  <li>Cp1252 and ASCII encodings represent 8% and 3%, respectively.</li>
  <li>Not a single responder mentions Cp1254, Cp1257, SJIS, KOI8_R, EUC_JP, Big5, Big5_HKSCS, ISO8859_3, ISO8859_4, ISO8859_5, ISO8859_6, ISO8859_7, ISO8859_8, ISO8859_9 or ISO8859_13</li>

  <li>RIS, Endnote and Medline are all above 10%.</li>
  <li>All the filters got chosen at least once.</li>
  <li>5% of responders declared using another filter. Based on the accompanying comments, it looks like some users are confused with the concept of filter.</li>

<h3 id="comparative-grading-of-the-potential-new-features">Comparative grading of the potential new features</h3>

<p>There is no universal way to analyse data from a Likert scale. We can try several gradings (see sections below), before proposing a consensus.</p>

<h4 id="grading-by-mode">Grading by mode</h4>
<p>The mode is simply the class which get the larger percentage. As such, we get:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Extremely useful:
    <ul>
      <li>BibLaTeX</li>
      <li>Ref Import</li>
      <li>Sharing</li>
      <li>Web Search</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Quite useful:
    <ul>
      <li>Better GUI</li>
      <li>Link Files – Annot</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Useful:
    <ul>
      <li>Clean Up</li>
      <li>Link Files – Other</li>
      <li>OS compatibility</li>
      <li>Ref Export</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Somehow useful:
    <ul>
      <li>Key Generation</li>
      <li>Sort Ref with Mind Mapping</li>
      <li>Sort Ref with System Recommender</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Not useful at all:
    <ul>
      <li>Better CLI</li>
      <li>Image Integration</li>
      <li>LibreOffice Integration</li>
      <li>Mobile</li>
      <li>MS Word Integration</li>
      <li>Social Network</li>
      <li>Web Interface</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We can note that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>reference importation has a high priority, and a higher priority than reference exportation.</li>
  <li>sorting of references whether by mind mapping or by a recommender system is seen as “Somehow useful” in both cases.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="grading-by-at-least-somehow-useful">Grading by “At least somehow useful”</h4>
<p>This is the sum of the percentages of all classes except “Not useful at all”; the higher, the more useful.</p>

<p><img src="graphs/FeatureAllAtLeast.png" alt="FeatureAllAtLeast" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>As for the “mode grading”, the following features are thought to be the less useful:
      - Better CLI
      - Image Integration
      - LibreOffice Integration
      - Mobile
      - MS Word Integration
      - Social Network
      - Web Interface</li>
  <li>Clearly, Social networking is the least desirable new feature.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="grading-by-quite-or-extremely-usefull">Grading by “Quite or extremely usefull”</h4>
<p>Based on adding the 2 top classes; the higher, the more useful.</p>

<p><img src="graphs/FeatureAllQuiteExtreme.png" alt="FeatureAllQuiteExtreme" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>As for the “mode grading”, the following features are thought to be the less useful:
      - Better CLI
      - Image Integration
      - LibreOffice Integration
      - Mobile
      - Social Network
      - Web Interface</li>
  <li>Clearly, Social networking is the least desirable new feature.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="compound-grading">Compound grading</h4>
<p>Based on the position of each feature in each previous grading, a mean position was calculated; the smaller, the better.</p>

<p><img src="graphs/FeatureAllCompound.png" alt="FeatureAllCompound" /></p>

<p>This grading is put forward for the consensus (see below).</p>

<h4 id="grading-consensus">Grading consensus</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Sharing and Reference importations are the more desirable</li>
  <li>Social network is the least desirable</li>
  <li>The head group is composed of:
    <ul>
      <li>Reference importation</li>
      <li>Sharing</li>
      <li>Better GUI</li>
      <li>BibLaTeX</li>
      <li>Clean up</li>
      <li>Link files by pdf annotation</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The tail group is composed of:
    <ul>
      <li>LibreOffice integration</li>
      <li>MS Word integration</li>
      <li>Better CLI</li>
      <li>Web Interface</li>
      <li>Image Integration</li>
      <li>Mobile</li>
      <li>Social Network</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Definitely, improving reference importation is more desirable than improving reference exportation.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Conclusion: some features are much more often requested, such as “Better Sharing” and “Better Reference importation”. Some are not wished, such as “Connection with social networks”.</p>

<h3 id="most-difficultannoying-issue">Most difficult/annoying issue</h3>
<p>Responders were asked about the most difficult/annoying issue when they manage their bibliography with JabRef.
More than half reported at least an issue, with a total of 370 issues. They also sometimes give hints for improvement.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Importation (73):
    <ul>
      <li>amount of work required to get an entry in the database.</li>
      <li>sub-adequate workflow. Many steps, some manual steps, including cleaning.</li>
      <li>from journal website, ideally, a Drag-and-Drop should be sufficient (as in alternative software).</li>
      <li>Cryptic error messages.</li>
      <li>associated files (especially pdf) should be automatically added.</li>
      <li>web search is sub-optimal, and sometimes does not work.</li>
      <li>available formats limited.</li>
      <li>cleaning of imported entries should be better.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>GUI is a major source of concern (57):
    <ul>
      <li>in a general manner, it is reported as cumbersome, bad, clunky, cluttered, ugly.</li>
      <li>more specific concerns about:
        <ul>
          <li>the table of entries.</li>
          <li>the group interface.</li>
          <li>the entry editing.</li>
          <li>the preferences.</li>
          <li>icons and font size.</li>
          <li>the keyword management.</li>
          <li>the layout of the menus.</li>
          <li>the search interface.</li>
          <li>the cleaning features.</li>
          <li>awful display with HiDPI screens.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>About entry editing (27), responders report:
    <ul>
      <li>Autocompletion does not work properly.</li>
      <li>inconsistencies with saving of the field values.</li>
      <li>incoherence of the field order in a tab and among tabs.</li>
      <li>the format of field strings is not easy to manage.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Special characters should not be an issue for users (24), through the whole workflow (importation, edition, exportation)</li>
  <li>Linked file management (17):
    <ul>
      <li>JabRef should have the capability to add them automatically.</li>
      <li>Should support external storage.</li>
      <li>metadata extraction.</li>
      <li>GUI could be improved.</li>
      <li>quick look of the files.</li>
      <li>annotation in the pdf.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Clean and consistent database (14), which mean cleaning both during importation and edition of entries</li>
  <li>Groups should be more efficient (13)</li>
  <li>Sharing database should be easier (13)</li>
  <li>Slow (12), especially to load and to save databases</li>
  <li>Exportation lacks some features (12), such as an easy way to choose journal-specific format, to design a specific format or to use the clipboard.</li>
  <li>File encoding (11), especially during import sharing.</li>
  <li>Poor support for BibLaTeX (10)</li>
  <li>Difficulty to eliminate duplicated entries (8)</li>
  <li>Integration with text editor or word processor: MS Word (9), TeXmaker (2), LibreOffice (1)</li>
  <li>Plug-ins and other external tools (7): they are difficult to find, do not always work well, lack integration.</li>
  <li>Search (6) should be easier to use, and should be extended to linked files.</li>
  <li>Sorting entries is not as easy as it should be (5). Related to groups, too.</li>
  <li>If preferences were attached to each database (4), it will make working with several databases easier (but also with one database with different computers.</li>
  <li>Poor handling of cross-references (4)</li>
  <li>key entry management (4)</li>
  <li>Help is insufficient or outdated (3)</li>
  <li>BibTeX files more friendly with Version Control Systems (3)</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Conclusion: Responders care about JabRef: they have numerous comment and suggestions.
JabRef, although great, has plenty of room for improvement! Importation of data, GUI and entry editing raised the more numerous issues.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="final-remarks-given-by-responders">Final remarks given by responders</h3>
<p>Responders could give final remarks. A quarter did. The vast majority were thanks and congratulations. Some comments addressed new points:</p>

<ul>
  <li>how to help in the development of JabRef, even if you are not a developer.</li>
  <li>financial contributions can come from companies (employers) and not from individuals.</li>
  <li>work with online LaTeX editing tools (such as overleaf).</li>
  <li>keep JabRef simple.</li>
</ul>
