# JabRef in Google Summer of Code 2020

This page lists a number of ideas for potential projects to be carried out by the students participating in Google Summer of Code 2020.
This is by no means a closed list, so the students can feel free to propose alternative activities related to the project (the [list of feature requests](http://discourse.jabref.org/c/features) and the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues) might serve as an additional source of inspiration).
Students are strongly encouraged to discuss their ideas with the developers and the community to improve their proposal until submission (e.g, using the [Gitter Channel](https://gitter.im/JabRef/jabref) or the [forum](http://discourse.jabref.org/)).
It's also a good idea to start working on [one of the smaller issues](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) to make yourself familiar with [the contribution process](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## PDF Integration

* *Description:* JabRef excels at organizing and searching the metadata of bibliographic entries. Often the user is also in the possession of the full text (e.g, the article in an electronic form). Currently, these PDF documents can be linked to the corresponding bibliographic entry but are not further analyzed. It would be worthwhile to expand JabRef's feature set in this regard, for example by adding full text search, automatic extraction of metadata from a PDF, extraction of cited bibliographic entries (and linking them to entries already in the user's library) and much more. Note that the main focus in this topic is the programming the interface and not the actual search algorithms.
* *Skills required:* Java (experiences with job management is a plus), JavaFX (experience with Lucene and/or information retrieveal is a plus)
* *Expected outcome:*
  * Integrated search interface which presents search results from attached PDF documents and/or
  * Extraction of additional metadata and a way to display them in the user interface.
* *Possible mentors:* [Tobias Diez](https://github.com/tobiasdiez)

## Microsoft Word Integration

* *Description:* Implement a direct bibliography integration with Microsoft Word. JabRef has a deep integration with BibTeX and biblatex, but can equally be valuable for authors that prefer writing in Microsoft Word. Currently, this integration is lacking and would be highly beneficial as an Open Source alternative to existing software such as Mendeley.
* *Old code* (not working): <https://github.com/JabRef/JabRef4Word>
* *Skills required:* Java, .NET
* *Expected outcome:* Basic integration of bibliographic functionalities such as inserting, editing, and synching bibliographic entries between Word and JabRef.
* *Possible mentors:* [Tobias Diez](https://github.com/tobiasdiez)

## Seamless Overleaf integration

* *Description*: [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) is the leading platform to colalborate on scientific publications based on LaTeX. Overleaf, however, misses collaboratively working on bibliographic entries. This is where JabRef jumps in: Changes to the bibliographic data on ShareLaTeX should transparently be integrated in the current local JabRef database, and vice versa. This feature would complement JabRef's [support of collaboratively working using a PostgreSQL database](http://help.jabref.org/en/SQLDatabase). Similar to that feature, in this task, the setting is that multiple users work on the BibTeX file. Thus, changes made "at other places" by other users should be integrated silently into JabRef (and not raising a dialog somehow).
* *Issue at GitHub:* Issue: <https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/156>
* *Skills required:* Java
* *Expected outcome:* JabRef should be able to connect to a Overleaf project and update bibliographic data there. Moreover, a local copy of the bibliography file has to kept updated. The tool should work seamingless if multiple users change different BibTeX entries.
* *Possible mentors:* [Oliver Kopp](https://github.com/koppor), [Christoph](https://github.com/Siedlerchr)

## Social JabRef

* *Description:* There are many tools out there to share information on publications. Be it summaries and comments on publications or be it some collections of bibliographic entries. [ShortSience.org](https://shortscience.org) is a platform for post-publication discussion aiming to improve accessibility and reproducibility of research ideas. [BibSonomy](https://www.bibsonomy.org/) is a tool to collect bibliopgrahic information. The aim of this task is to integrate both ShortScience and BibSonomy.
* *Issue at GitHub:* Issue: <https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/5888>
* *Skills required:* Java
* *Possible mentors:* [Oliver Kopp](https://github.com/koppor)
