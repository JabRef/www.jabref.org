For a longtime, a single click on a toolbar button has allowed JabRef to insert citations in [WinEdt](http://www.winedt.com).

WinEdt is a powerful and versatile all-purpose text editor for Windows with a strong predisposition towards the creation and compilation of LaTeX documents.

Up to now, communication was only one-way: from JabRef to WinEdt.
This time is over: since April 2, 2016, WinEdt can also communicate with Jabref!

Thanks to [a package contributed by Karl Koeller](http://www.winedt.org/config/menus/JabRef.html),
JabRef can be launched from within WinEdt.
