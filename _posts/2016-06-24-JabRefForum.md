In cooperation with [discourse](http://www.discourse.org) a new forum for JabRef has just been opened!

You can find it by now in main navigation on JabRef.org or directly here: http://discourse.jabref.org



During the last years we started to move away from sourceforge.net (for various reasons): The code is now managed at GitHub, downloads are handled by FossHub and we are using our own domain JabRef.org for hosting the website and this blog.

However, there we still some things left at sourceforge: 
Longstanding JabRef user might be aware that there was forum at sourceforge some time ago which has been closed.
Moreover, there are two mailing lists on for developers, and [one for users](https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/jabref-users).

With the new forum we now again provide an easy to use platform to ask questions (and hopefully to get answers) from the JabRef community.
Thus, we decided to officially discontinue the support on the mailing list. We'll leave the list open for some time - but the official communcation channels for the future will be the GitHub issue tracker and the discourse forum.

For those of you who like to stick with a mailing-list like behavior we provide you a guide on how to use the discourse forum just like a mailing list.

*Thanks again to [discourse.org](http://www.discourse.org) for the great software and especially for providing us free hosting!*
